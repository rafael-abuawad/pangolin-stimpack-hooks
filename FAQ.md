## Project Name
**Pangolin Stimpack Hooks**

## Tagline
A simple set of hooks designed to incentivize liquidity and trading.

## Why am I Participating in the Hackathon?
Pangolin was the first DEX on Avalanche, and I believe that V3 will bring substantial upgrades to the protocol. Even though it’s challenging to develop for a protocol that isn’t available yet, I am convinced that the main concept behind this hackathon is solid and could be extremely useful if implemented correctly.

## What Challenges am I Focusing On?
Hooks represent a new method for extending DeFi functionality. With hooks, developers can launch new applications without the need to bootstrap liquidity or attract users from scratch. Enabling regular users to create hooks without coding skills is a natural next step, opening the door for broader innovation and empowering more people to engage with DeFi.

## How Does My Submission Address This Challenge?
The hooks in this repository are simple but highly effective. The user interface features gamified elements that make it both user-friendly and intuitive. With an extensive catalog of hooks, this project can become a go-to resource for users and entrepreneurs alike.

## Challenges I Ran Into
Developing for an unreleased protocol posed some difficulties, but this serves as a functional MVP for when the protocol is production-ready.
