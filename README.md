## **Introduction**
The **Pangolin Stimpack Hooks** project is inspired by Pangolin DEX’s role as the first decentralized exchange on Avalanche and the upcoming features in Pangolin V3. Hooks offer an innovative way to extend DeFi functionality by enabling applications that don’t require initial liquidity or user acquisition from scratch. With a growing catalog, this project can become a valuable tool for both users and entrepreneurs.

## **Key Features**
- **Hook Simplicity**: A streamlined set of hooks for developers, lowering the barrier to entry for creating DeFi applications.
- **Gamified User Interface**: Interactive elements make the experience engaging and intuitive, suitable for users with varying technical backgrounds.
- **Empowerment Through Accessibility**: Allows non-developers to create and deploy hooks, promoting innovation within the community.

## **How It Works**

### **Hooks Overview**
